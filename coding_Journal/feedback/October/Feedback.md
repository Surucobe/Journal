## Slacking off vs being sick
Been feeling sick the past couple of days and i'm afraid i'm using my condition to slack off
It is important i keep myself in good shape and healthy and be careful to not judge me too hard on things i can't control such as getting sick

## Struggling with motivation
As of late i have been struggling a lot to motivate myself, i even wonder what's the point of this journal orany i have ever written really
My gums hurt, my teeth feel tight, i am unemployed, i don't wish to simply get any job, i wanna get money
I feel myself frustrated at my decisions and how i act, i wanna make a change but i don't put the work into it
I hate myself and for whatever reason i can find a reason to do anything, i fear death and i fear to live

## Small progress
I have been making slow and small progress towards the things i wish to achieved, although i'm happy to keep improving i feel myself frustrated for not working harder
I know i shouldn't pressure myself so much however is difficult to simply feel myself satisfied when i don't finish things
I need to put deadlines on myself thing i need to accomplish withing a set time

## feels more like progress
I have manage to do a bit more today although i'm not satisfy yet i feel at ease, there are certain thing i need to fix
The way i work is one thing i must change and also the approach i have towards study and how i handle my life
As of now i have no money, i got things i need to do and no clue how to do them, all i can rely on is the idea i will get a gig to help me get some cash
I don't know what else to put in here today

## Doing maybe too much
I have set my goal into three different areas, learning RPA, python and finish my learning of javascript
Although rpa and python will go hand by hand reality is i may be taking too much and i may not be handling it well enough
I need to stablish ways to work this in order for me to be able to study properly and also work on projects

## Doing the enough
i have manage to study and work a bit more on what i wished to worked on today, although my journey through RPA has been a difficult one i believe i have finally manage to find a starting point
My studies of RPA were fairly stopped today due to the poor net connection of today, this happened in both internet lines...
The lastest Odin Project lesson has been challenging, i do not know where to even start and i don't work on it in the way i feel like i should
Maybe is time for me to get more strict with myself

## You won't know till you try
After spending some solid few days wondering what i should do with a project i was too afraid to even try i finished after giving it some thinking
The solution was rather simple and i could keep going and finishing some more fancy way to work the project but i feel like i wish to continue
I have to work on another 2 different project, named my portfolio and RPA with python, which i didn't do today but i am looking forward to do so

## Neglecting my resposabilities
These past two days i neglected what i had to do, barely doing some of the things but in that spirit i am failing at what i mean to achieve
I need tog et myself serious about the things i wanna accomplish otherwise they will forever be dreams
I struggle with the idea of setting immediate consequences if i truly wish to accomplish something i must focus and work hard
