## Slacking off vs being sick
Been feeling sick the past couple of days and i'm afraid i'm using my condition to slack off
It is important i keep myself in good shape and healthy and be careful to not judge me too hard on things i can't control such as getting sick

## Struggling with motivation
As of late i have been struggling a lot to motivate myself, i even wonder what's the point of this journal orany i have ever written really
My gums hurt, my teeth feel tight, i am unemployed, i don't wish to simply get any job, i wanna get money
I feel myself frustrated at my decisions and how i act, i wanna make a change but i don't put the work into it
I hate myself and for whatever reason i can find a reason to do anything, i fear death and i fear to live

## Small progress
I have been making slow and small progress towards the things i wish to achieved, although i'm happy to keep improving i feel myself frustrated for not working harder
I know i shouldn't pressure myself so much however is difficult to simply feel myself satisfied when i don't finish things
I need to put deadlines on myself thing i need to accomplish withing a set time

## feels more like progress
I have manage to do a bit more today although i'm not satisfy yet i feel at ease, there are certain thing i need to fix
The way i work is one thing i must change and also the approach i have towards study and how i handle my life
As of now i have no money, i got things i need to do and no clue how to do them, all i can rely on is the idea i will get a gig to help me get some cash
I don't know what else to put in here today
