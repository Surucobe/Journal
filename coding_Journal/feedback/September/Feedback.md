### Mistakes were made
I made a major mistake a fucked up my journal, so i'm using as both an excuse and oppotunity to take back this journal here
I have progress in an interesting way on my journey and i have decided to participate in the TOP community even iif only with a small message but a step is a step

### Mistakes were made
Today i didn't feel like working on anything, maybe cause i went out very early and felt off from it
Maybe cause i been feeling down for my current situation but over all i barely code, but i did code indeed!
I need to find a way to get out of this feeling of sadness and incompetence

### Uneasy feeling
I haven't been feeling well as of late, i feel rather sluggish and unmotivated i feel unsure as of to what to do
I know i have to keep on studying and that my time is running out but is been a struggle lately, with nearly everything actually
I need to change something, need to do something in orderto change my routine and make a difference
