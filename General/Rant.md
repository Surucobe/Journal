# Rant zone
The idea of this file is simple, i just want to type word and vent out my frustration... towards myself mostly, the ides behind this is yet to be clear but i'm trying to put some order into my life
Going back into my routine has proven to be quite the challenge, not even sure how to feel about it is all honesty
Even worse i have been struggling not just with motivation again but focusing in a single task at hand has proven to be difficult
My plan is simple, divide the day up between the time to play and be leisure about and the time to work and study, that's the plan so far
