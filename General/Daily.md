Need to learn to restrain myself and have self control, the lack of this made things nearly impossible today
I do seem motivated to do things but i easily distract myself and possibly sabotage myself as well
I currently feel awkward with the situation

I manage to study today, read about promises and callbacks i yet have to code tho, this is becoming a problem but all i need to do is set mysefl rules
i need to set up an hour to start and a fix amount to do daily and slowly imrpove both my skills and that time

Didn't study today, however i did manage to code more than yesterday, as little as that may have been i still manage to code
I have finally started building my portfolio the design is unclear as for now the only objective is to convey the information
For tomorrow i wish to actually study and in order to do so i will prevent myself from distracting with video games, i will not play until i'm done with my studies

### Bulding discipline
I have become lazy towards my goals, not giving them their proper time and not giving me the respectful time i need to work on them, instead playing game
I need to be better than this, i cannot allow this to keep going on

### Bulding discipline
first day of building discipline: i determine myself to not play a specific game today, which i didn't and not just that but i essencially did not play any game at all today
is an unusual day for this is not something i usually do, instead i spent most of the day studying, i code little yes but that's because i spent most of the day studying about coding

### Bulding discipline
Currently displeased with my own performance, i literally took away games from me and yet still i manage to fail to accomplish all of my task
i remember readin that adding a sort of punishment or inmmediate consequence to failing this actions can be a huge help, the problem is that idk what i could make in order to help me with those
Fair is to say that today i wished to play inscyption, which i did and enjoy doing so even tho i either forgot how to play or game got harder, could be any really

### Bulding discipline
Decided to change the strategy, after experimenting with a new way to work my routine i realized that it wasn't working
I have decided to use my previous approach instead, today it has been a general success aside from still getting use to it, again, it showed results today

### Bulding discipline
Second day with my previous routine building and is giving better results, i feel more commited to acoomplishing whaat i decide to do on my day to day
I have consider adjusting a few of the things i do and trying to be more specific with what i wanna do, also setting times would be ideal

### Bulding discipline
Third day and i have manage to improve, imagae to code for an hour under a pomodoro strategy, today i have manage to do nearly everything i had in my list
Missing few things to finish my list does tel me i need to tweak a few things still but i'm on the right path
However i'm still missing some key elements to feel satisfied with my day to day, name actually sending my CV to companies and finish my protfolio

### Starting is easy keeping up is hard
Today i didn't manage to do everything this was due to my own negligence, i decided to do something else, more specifically play games
I don't blame the game because i have seen and experience that  even removing them accomplish nothing very sadly, i'm facing a new challenge in my coding journey
Rather i'm facing many this time around i need to set goals on my day to day aside from what is a routine for me
In order to progress i need to set what i also need to start working on
