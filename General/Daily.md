Need to learn to restrain myself and have self control, the lack of this made things nearly impossible today
I do seem motivated to do things but i easily distract myself and possibly sabotage myself as well
I currently feel awkward with the situation

Didn't study today, however i did manage to code more than yesterday, as little as that may have been i still manage to code
I have finally started building my portfolio the design is unclear as for now the only objective is to convey the information
For tomorrow i wish to actually study and in order to do so i will prevent myself from distracting with video games, i will not play until i'm done with my studies

### Bulding discipline
I have become lazy towards my goals, not giving them their proper time and not giving me the respectful time i need to work on them, instead playing game
I need to be better than this, i cannot allow this to keep going on
