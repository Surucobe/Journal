Today i have decided that i need to learn more markdown and put more thought into this

## Date 06/08/2024
Need to learn to restrain myself and have self control, the lack of this made things nearly impossible today
I do seem motivated to do things but i easily distract myself and possibly sabotage myself as well
I currently feel awkward with the situation

## Date 07/08/2024
I manage to study today, read about promises and callbacks i yet have to code tho, this is becoming a problem but all i need to do is set mysefl rules
i need to set up an hour to start and a fix amount to do daily and slowly imrpove both my skills and that time

## Date 08/08/2024
Didn't study today, however i did manage to code more than yesterday, as little as that may have been i still manage to code
I have finally started building my portfolio the design is unclear as for now the only objective is to convey the information
For tomorrow i wish to actually study and in order to do so i will prevent myself from distracting with video games, i will not play until i'm done with my studies

### Bulding discipline
I have become lazy towards my goals, not giving them their proper time and not giving me the respectful time i need to work on them, instead playing game
I need to be better than this, i cannot allow this to keep going on

## Date 20/08/2024
### Bulding discipline
first day of building discipline: i determine myself to not play a specific game today, which i didn't and not just that but i essencially did not play any game at all today
is an unusual day for this is not something i usually do, instead i spent most of the day studying, i code little yes but that's because i spent most of the day studying about coding

### Bulding discipline
Currently displeased with my own performance, i literally took away games from me and yet still i manage to fail to accomplish all of my task
i remember readin that adding a sort of punishment or inmmediate consequence to failing this actions can be a huge help, the problem is that idk what i could make in order to help me with those
Fair is to say that today i wished to play inscyption, which i did and enjoy doing so even tho i either forgot how to play or game got harder, could be any really

### Bulding discipline
Decided to change the strategy, after experimenting with a new way to work my routine i realized that it wasn't working
I have decided to use my previous approach instead, today it has been a general success aside from still getting use to it, again, it showed results today

### Bulding discipline
Second day with my previous routine building and is giving better results, i feel more commited to acoomplishing whaat i decide to do on my day to day
I have consider adjusting a few of the things i do and trying to be more specific with what i wanna do, also setting times would be ideal

### Bulding discipline
Third day and i have manage to improve, imagae to code for an hour under a pomodoro strategy, today i have manage to do nearly everything i had in my list
Missing few things to finish my list does tel me i need to tweak a few things still but i'm on the right path
However i'm still missing some key elements to feel satisfied with my day to day, name actually sending my CV to companies and finish my protfolio

### Starting is easy keeping up is hard
Today i didn't manage to do everything this was due to my own negligence, i decided to do something else, more specifically play games
I don't blame the game because i have seen and experience that  even removing them accomplish nothing very sadly, i'm facing a new challenge in my coding journey
Rather i'm facing many this time around i need to set goals on my day to day aside from what is a routine for me
In order to progress i need to set what i also need to start working on

### Starting is easy keeping up is hard
Not everything was accomplish, specifically the portfolio part, i technically still have time and could manage to do sobut i would still feel like i failed
i wish to fix my behavior but this ain't magic nor is an easy process but i'm running against the clock in order to achieve this
I have manage to grasp ideas and motions about how i should be doing things, i have manage to work better although i'm still lacking 
I need a cue, something that sets my mind into the idea that i'm gonna start coding and won't stop for a long while

### Starting is easy keeping up is hard
I don't feel exactly please with today's performance but i don't feel totally displeased either i am overall satisfied
I worked on my mergesort challenge today and manage to do decent progress by breaking down the problems into simple steps, i manage to focus for 25 minutes streight, if not 30, into purely coding
i have finished most of the task in my list except for 1 or two i'm missing, i am yet to work in my porfolio however

### Recursivity and mergesort be damn
It's been hard to work this around, i've been oing my best to find a way to work thris through on my own but i may have to give up on that idea
It's been too difficult and i'm unsure how to solve some parts fo this, i'm sure if i continue i will find the answer
But the more time i spend on this part the more furstrated i feel, despite learning how to deal with this there is a reality i must pay attention to
I need money and a job

### Recursivity and mergesort solved!
shortly after yesterdays update i manage to solve the problem effectively making my code functional, i am yet to know if i can make it better
As i type that the question of "why?" comes to my mind, is not a matter of "it can always be improved" but rather "acknowledge you did well"
I must celebrate and learn to treasure my victories
