Need to learn to restrain myself and have self control, the lack of this made things nearly impossible today
I do seem motivated to do things but i easily distract myself and possibly sabotage myself as well
I currently feel awkward with the situation

Didn't study today, however i did manage to code more than yesterday, as little as that may have been i still manage to code
I have finally started building my portfolio the design is unclear as for now the only objective is to convey the information
For tomorrow i wish to actually study and in order to do so i will prevent myself from distracting with video games, i will not play until i'm done with my studies

### Bulding discipline
I have become lazy towards my goals, not giving them their proper time and not giving me the respectful time i need to work on them, instead playing game
I need to be better than this, i cannot allow this to keep going on

### Bulding discipline
first day of building discipline: i determine myself to not play a specific game today, which i didn't and not just that but i essencially did not play any game at all today
is an unusual day for this is not something i usually do, instead i spent most of the day studying, i code little yes but that's because i spent most of the day studying about coding

### Bulding discipline
Currently displeased with my own performance, i literally took away games from me and yet still i manage to fail to accomplish all of my task
i remember readin that adding a sort of punishment or inmmediate consequence to failing this actions can be a huge help, the problem is that idk what i could make in order to help me with those
Fair is to say that today i wished to play inscyption, which i did and enjoy doing so even tho i either forgot how to play or game got harder, could be any really
